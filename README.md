speedtest.net CLI
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/keir-rex/speedtest-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/keir-rex/speedtest-cli) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/keir-rex/speedtest-cli)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/keir-rex/speedtest-cli)

This is a simple command line client to speedtest.net written in Go.

It is a direct port from https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli written in Python. It lacks some of the features though, e.g. `-mini` and `-share` options are not supported.

Installation
------------

Dowload a pre-built binary from [releases](https://github.com/keir-rex/speedtest-cli/releases) such as:

```
curl -L https://github.com/keir-rex/speedtest-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/speedtest-cli_linux_amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/speedtest-cli
chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/speedtest-cli
```

Or build from latest source
